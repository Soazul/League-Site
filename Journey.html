    <p> Hey, my name is Annie. I have been an active League of Legends player since my sophomore year of high school. It
        all began
        when my parents brought me my first laptop; my brother suggested that I should play a game with him. That begins
        my
        journey with League and video games. I locked in Lux in the tutorial and learned the foundation of the game. I
        enjoyed playing Lux,
        so I became a Lux main for my first year. Afterward, I started to expand my champion pool in the support role. I
        started
        to play Zyra and Morgana, which I enjoyed because I had an easier time landing my skill shots. During the
        pandemic, I
        began to play more frequently with my friend. It was the main way my friends and I connected despite the
        distance.
        My friend was a Nami support main, so I explored my next main, Ahri. However, I quickly found out that
        last-hitting
        minions wasn't something I could do properly. As a result, I went back to the bottom lane and started to play
        Nami. Nami
        was an enchanter support, which didn't fit my usual playstyle of burst mages. Nonetheless, Nami is still a
        champion
        I actively play. After starting college, I had a small burnout with the game and took a short break and explored
        games
        such as Stardew Valley, For the King, Among Us, and Overcooked 2. I quickly got bored with those games as well
        and restarted
        to start my league journey. I wanted to try a new play style and champion, so I played a lot of ARAM. In my
        fourth game of ARAM,
        I played Rakan and I enjoyed the mobility in his kit. As a result, I started to play Rakan in my games, and I am
        now a Rakan main.</p>
    <br>
    <p> League of Legends and video games, in general, brought me joy and happiness on the days when I needed it the
        most.
        Playing video games with my friends brought me closer to them as we had a way to spend time together regardless
        of distance.
        In college, playing games allowed me to take a break from the stressful harsh reality and transported me to a
        world
        where I am stressed-free of real-world problems. I want to make games, to share this feeling with others.
        Therefore, I chose Computer Science and Game Development as my major. </p>
