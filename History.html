        Riot Games was established in September 2006 in Santa Monica, California by Brandon Beck and Marc Merrill.
        In October 2009, they released their debut title, League of Legends. By 2013, League of Legends became the
        most-played
        multiplayer PC game in the world. During the years 2014 and 2016, the player base grew from 67 million to 100
        million.
        In 2015, Riot Games relocated its headquarters to Los Angeles, California. By 2020, Riot Games released 4
        additional
        games, such as Teamfight Tactics (2019), Legends of Runeterra (2020), Valorant (2020), and Wild Rift (2020).
        They
        are
        also currently working on LoL Esports Manager, Project L, Project F, and an MMORPG. Riot Games collaborated with
        the French animation studio, Fortiche, and produced an animation series called "Arcane" which won the
        Emmy for Best Animated Program in 2022. The company is currently lead by CEO Nicolo Laurent
        and has over 4,500 employees in over 20 offices worldwide.

        The League of Legends Championship Series, commonly known as Worlds, is the biggest annual esports tournament.
        For the Worlds in 2022, it peaked at 5.1 million watchers. Worlds consist of 12 international leagues and over
        100 teams, where every team competes with each other to win a skin line, a grand trophy, and the title of the
        season.
        DRX, a Korean team, won Worlds 2022 and Edward Gaming, a Chinese team, won Worlds 2021. The Korean and Chinese
        teams
        are the dominating teams for Worlds in the past few years. Aside from Worlds, a tournament that started in 2011,
        the second most popular and important international tournament is the Mid-Season Invitational also known as MSI,
        a tournament that originated in 2015. This tournament takes place at the midway point of the season.
        For 2022, the prize of $250,000 was won by Royal Never Give Up, the most successful team with 3 MSI titles.
        In 2021, Riot Games also hosted its first Valorant Champions, an annual international tournament.
        In 2022, it was the 8th highest-viewed esports event with 1.5 million viewers.

    </figure>
    <p>
        In 2012, there was a rise of toxicity and harassment in-game, so Riot Games created a player behavior team.
        The team implemented functionalities that allow players to request a ban, mute players in-game and designed an
        Honor
        System. In 2021, Riot Game announced that chat between opposing teams would be disabled in certain regions.
        In 2022, they released a zero-tolerance language detection system that automatically mutes players that partake
        in
        verbal abuse.
        Despite these efforts, League of Legends is notoriously known for having the most toxic community. Players
        strongly
        believe that the problem stems from the lack of verbal communication, the gameplay being team-originated heavy,
        and
        the flawed toxicity behavioral and smurfing detection system.
