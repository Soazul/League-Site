    <h3>Summoner Rift Map: Three lanes with each team having a jungle, 11 turrets, 3 inhibitors, and 1 nexus.</h3>
    <img src="https://d1ki6hjeuoplax.cloudfront.net/images/Summoner-Rift-Map.png"
         alt="Summoner Rift Map" width="775" height="480" class="center">
    <p>There are 5 roles: Top, Mid, ADC, Support, and Jungler, and 2 teams, red and blue. The objective is to be the
        first team to destroy the
        opposing team's nexus; players must destroy the outer turrets first, followed by inner turrets, inhibitor
        turrets, and nexus turrets.
        To accomplish this, players can kill minions and enemies or get objectives to earn gold and upgrade their items.
        Items increase a champion's abilities or defensive stat, and an optimal itemization helps a team close or
        increase the gap.
        When the game begins, Top and Middle go to their respective lanes, ADC and Support goes to the bottom lane, and
        the Jungler goes to the jungle. As the game progressed, the Jungler would ambush the enemy team with the help of
        their allies to get a gold lead. Around the 15 minutes mark, also known as the mid-game, players tend to focus
        on
        objectives like turrets, dragons, barons, and the Rift Heralds. Around the 30 minutes mark, also known as the
        late-game, players tend to focus on getting a lead by staying together and team fighting. Certain team
        compositions
        excel at different phases of the game, as there are early, mid, and late-game champions.</p>
